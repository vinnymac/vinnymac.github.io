I noticed immediately how much faster it was, and that was in part due to how much work has gone into making gatsby produce an optimized site. I recently watched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLNYkxOF6rcICc687SxHQRuo9TVNOJelSZ&#x26;v=6m_E-mC0y3Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">video</a> by Sam Saccone and Paul Irish about performance and metrics. They spoke about two tools <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Lighthouse</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/paulirish/pwmetrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PWMetrics</a> which you can use today to measure your site performance in a useful way. I was able to quickly grasp what bottlenecks were having an adverse affect on the blogs load times.</p>\n<p>Through diagnosis I was able to drastically improve the score. Here is what I get from pwmetrics today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/pwmetrics.png\"><img src=\"/media/pwmetrics.png\" alt=\"PWMetrics\"></a></p>\n<p>You can even generate it yourself. Just try out the commands below.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> global <span class=\"token function\">add</span> pwmetrics\npwmetrics https://vincenttaverna.com</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\"><span class=\"token function\">yarn</span> global <span class=\"token function\">add</span> lighthouse\nlighthouse https://vincenttaverna.com</code></pre></div>\n<p>The next version of GatsbyJS, v1, is being developed right now. It will improve performance even more so, and I am really looking forward to it. Between inline CSS, offline support via service workers, and more, it will be the best release yet. If I find spare time I will definitely be contributing to it and I think you should to!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/blog-performance/","tagSlugs":["/tag/java-script/","/tag/gatsby/","/tag/performance/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-11-25T02:06:00.000Z","description":"Gatsby and Metrics for the new blog.","tags":["JavaScript","Gatsby","Performance"],"title":"Blog Performance"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/blog-performance/"}}}
