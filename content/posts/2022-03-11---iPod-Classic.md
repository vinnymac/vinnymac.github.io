description: "Reviving an iPod Classic from the dead"
---

Many of us have had extra time on our hands to tinker, or fix the world around us these last couple of years. I've always had my hand in electronics since I was a kid, digging through boxes and finding some old device like a Camera that was 5x my age. My curiosity always got the best of me, and I'd end up with a table full of parts by the end of the night, trying to determine which one was preventing the device from functioning. I found myself recently experiencing this same child-like adventure, after unpacking a box of old electronics in my basement. I came across an old iPod 4th Generation, and after rummaging around for a cable, and painfully waiting to see if the battery still functioned, I discovered that it was in fact dead.

### Research

At first I decided I would charge it for 5 hours, let it sit for 30 minutes. Then charge for another 5 hours. Interestingly, I could hear the disk spinning up and down, every time I attempted to turn it on, by pressing `MENU + SELECT` simultaneously. With each wurr of the hard drive, it was as if it was attempting to come to life, but could not. The screen was blank and soulless, and I wasn't quite sure exactly how a 20 year old device that held the secrets of my childhood music could possibly function again.

I was relatively sure that the hard drive could be fixed, and that the battery was operating somehow. I assumed that either the headphone jack was broken, since if it was stuck in HOLD it would not respond to button presses, or that the clickwheel itself had malfunctioned. Additionally, since the screen was not turning on and displaying a charge symbol, I knew something was wrong with that as well. To determine what exactly was going wrong, I would have to open it.

Fortunately, this is not the first time I have attmepted a fix like this, and I have some great tools I've collected over the years from upgrading phones or fixing electrical tools. iFixit has this wonderful set that I find invaluable for these types of tear downs of small devices.

Opening the iPod required some thin devices, ideally made of plastic. I used a couple guitar picks and some old SIM cards to release one of the 12 tabs holding the front face plate in its casing.

As soon as the face plate was removed, I noticed a major issue. The headphone jack was disconnected from the main board, and the wire itself was missing entirely. What happened to it, I will never know, likely only 14 year old me knows the answer to that mystery. Since my iPod 4G was a `A1059` model, I would need to find a `632-0260` cable for my headphone jack. I used a multimeter to verify the battery was functional, and also tested the other iPod components. After reseating the cable that connected to the display, I was able to get a picture, showing the device was charging. A small victory, but still we would not be able to use the clickwheel or headphone jack without further diagnostics, and while the battery was functional it was not holding a charge.

I found a great resource online called `Elite Obsolete Electronics`, where [iPod 4G replacement parts](https://eoe.works/collections/ipod-monochrome-4th-generation-parts) are readily available for purchase. The [headphone jack](https://eoe.works/collections/ipod-monochrome-4th-generation-parts/products/headphone-jack-hold-switch-flex-cable-for-apple-ipod-classic-monochrome-4th-generation) has three options to choose from, I went with the `Flex Cable Only` option, since my headphone jack appeared to be okay. Additionally I added a [1300mah Li-ion replacement battery](https://eoe.works/collections/ipod-monochrome-4th-generation-parts/products/insten-1300mah-li-ion-replacement-battery-for-apple-ipod-classic-4th-generation-monochrome-photo) to my cart, since it would be nice to actually be able to use the device once repaired.
